I am looking for a protein marker linked to a highly invasive cutaneous malignancy of melanocytic origin called melanoma. Search a curated, reviewed human protein database as of April 2026 for human entries. From the results, rank candidates by the number of disease-associated variants annotated in the database in descending order and retrieve the top five. For each of the five genes, retrieve expression data from a human tissue expression database and retain only those genes that have skin-related tissue expression data available (including skin-derived cell types and tissues such as skin, melanocyte, keratinocyte, basal cell, fibroblast, epidermis, dermal, hair follicle, or lesional) that is present in at least one sample with non-zero expression (TPM &gt; 0.001). For each retained gene, count the number of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants specifically as of April 21, 2026. Rank the genes by descending variant count and report the full name and symbol of the top-ranked gene.

You have access to Biomni's biomedical tool suite. Every Biomni tool is importable in Python as `biomni.tool.<domain>.<name>` and runnable from Bash, e.g. `python -c "from biomni.tool.<domain> import <name>; print(<name>(...))"`. The biomni package and its conda env (`/opt/conda/envs/biomni_e1/`) are installed on this container.

Before writing code, consult the on-container reference so you call the right function with the right arguments instead of guessing:

- `/biomni/biomni/tool/<domain>.py` — implementations of every tool, grouped by domain (genomics, pharmacology, molecular_biology, literature, database, etc.); read the function you intend to use for its exact signature and behavior. `database.py` holds the `query_*` helpers for the large reference DBs.
- `/biomni/biomni/env_desc.py` — descriptions of the local data-lake files and the available data resources, so you know what is already on disk before fetching anything.
- `/biomni/biomni/know_how/*.md` — step-by-step playbooks for common workflows (e.g. gene/drug-target identification, sgRNA design, single-cell annotation); skim the relevant guide before starting a multi-step analysis.

## Local data already on the container

The Biomni data lake is mounted read-only at `/workspace/data/biomni_data/data_lake/` — 76 curated biomedical files including BindingDB, GeneBass, GTEx, DepMap, GWAS catalog, gene-info, DDInter, MSigDB, miRTarBase, GO, etc. **Check `/biomni/biomni/AVAILABLE_DATA.md` for the full inventory with one-line descriptions before downloading anything from a public API**; reading a local parquet/CSV is much faster than refetching from the internet.

For larger reference databases (PubChem, UniProt, PubMed, ChEMBL, OpenTargets, ClinVar, ENCODE, etc.), prefer the corresponding `biomni.tool.database.query_*` functions — they auto-route to the local SQLite copy when available and fall back to the live API otherwise.

## Final answer

When you have your answer, write it — and only it, no prose explanation — to `/workspace/answer.md`. Keep it terse by default; but if the task specifies an output format (e.g. JSON, a table, a SMILES string, a comma-separated list), produce exactly that format as the answer.
