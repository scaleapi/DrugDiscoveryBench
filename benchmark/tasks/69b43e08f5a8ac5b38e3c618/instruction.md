I'm investigating atypical small cell lung cancer. I want you to do the following as of March 2026:

Step 1. Search for the most frequently mutated gene (gene with the largest number of mutations) for atypical small cell lung cancer.

Step 2. Look for the protein sequence of the gene found in step 1.

Step 3. Search for small molecules targeting the protein sequence found in the previous step.

Step 4. Fetch the compound with the lowest IC50 value (in nM) and use molecular weight as the tiebreaker.

Step 5. Perform a similarity search using a Tanimoto coefficient threshold of 0.4 on the compound identified in the previous step.

Step 6. Only return the smiles, molecular weight, and similarity of the compound with the highest similarity with the compound found in step 4.

You have access to Biomni's biomedical tool suite. Every Biomni tool is importable in Python as `biomni.tool.<domain>.<name>` and runnable from Bash, e.g. `python -c "from biomni.tool.<domain> import <name>; print(<name>(...))"`. The biomni package and its conda env (`/opt/conda/envs/biomni_e1/`) are installed on this container.

Before writing code, consult the on-container reference so you call the right function with the right arguments instead of guessing:

- `/biomni/biomni/tool/<domain>.py` — implementations of every tool, grouped by domain (genomics, pharmacology, molecular_biology, literature, database, etc.); read the function you intend to use for its exact signature and behavior. `database.py` holds the `query_*` helpers for the large reference DBs.
- `/biomni/biomni/env_desc.py` — descriptions of the local data-lake files and the available data resources, so you know what is already on disk before fetching anything.
- `/biomni/biomni/know_how/*.md` — step-by-step playbooks for common workflows (e.g. gene/drug-target identification, sgRNA design, single-cell annotation); skim the relevant guide before starting a multi-step analysis.

## Local data already on the container

The Biomni data lake is mounted read-only at `/workspace/data/biomni_data/data_lake/` — 76 curated biomedical files including BindingDB, GeneBass, GTEx, DepMap, GWAS catalog, gene-info, DDInter, MSigDB, miRTarBase, GO, etc. **Check `/biomni/biomni/AVAILABLE_DATA.md` for the full inventory with one-line descriptions before downloading anything from a public API**; reading a local parquet/CSV is much faster than refetching from the internet.

For larger reference databases (PubChem, UniProt, PubMed, ChEMBL, OpenTargets, ClinVar, ENCODE, etc.), prefer the corresponding `biomni.tool.database.query_*` functions — they auto-route to the local SQLite copy when available and fall back to the live API otherwise.

## Final answer

When you have your answer, write it — and only it, no prose explanation — to `/workspace/answer.md`. Keep it terse by default; but if the task specifies an output format (e.g. JSON, a table, a SMILES string, a comma-separated list), produce exactly that format as the answer.
